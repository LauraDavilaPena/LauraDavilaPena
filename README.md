- 👋 Hi, I’m Laura Davila Pena, a PhD student at the Universidade de Santiago de Compostela (Spain). 
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in Operations Research and Game Theory. As you can deduce from my codes, I mainly work on R. I plan to learn Python or C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on transport problems, cooperative games, etc. Anything that seems interesting : ) I'm an enthusiastic person who loves learning new thinks and 
     working with people.
- 📫 If you have further concerns about my work or my code, you can write me on lauradavila.pena@usc.es !
