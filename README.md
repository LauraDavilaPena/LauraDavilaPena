- 👋 Hi, I’m Laura Davila Pena, a postdoctoral researcher at Kent Business School, University of Kent (UK). I got my PhD in Statistics and Operations Research from Universidade de Santiago de Compostela (Spain). 
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in Operations Research and Game Theory. As you can deduce from my codes, I mainly work on R. I plan to learn Python or C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on transport problems, location problems, applications of cooperative games, etc. Anything that seems interesting :) I'm an enthusiastic person who loves learning new things and 
     working with other people.
- 📫 If you have further concerns about my work or my codes, you can write me on lauradavila.pena@usc.es or l.davila-pena@kent.ac.uk!
